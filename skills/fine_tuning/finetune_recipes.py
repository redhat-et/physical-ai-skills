"""Fine-tuning recipes: per-model ordered stage lists for submit_finetune_run.

A recipe's stages run as separate Kubernetes Jobs, in order, each overriding
the same training image's command -- see the platform_agent fine-tuning
plan for why (no Kubeflow/Tekton available on this cluster; Tekton's CRDs
aren't installed despite pre-provisioned RBAC, and KFP/DSPA would need a new
SDK dependency and an unconfirmed auth story). Kept as a plain Python
constant, not a generic multi-architecture schema, until a second recipe
exists to generalize from.

pi0.5's recipe trains via LeRobot's own native `lerobot-train` CLI (pure
PyTorch, https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/pi05), not openpi's JAX
scripts -- confirmed that `lerobot/pi05_base` (the checkpoint our
openpi-runtime already serves live) is exactly LeRobot's own
PreTrainedPolicy save format (config.json + model.safetensors +
pre/post-processor json), so a lerobot-train checkpoint should load with
zero conversion via that same serving setup. No custom TrainConfig shim
needed either -- lerobot-train is a normal CLI.

    recipe. Uses the MEAN_STD normalization override instead of the
    QUANTILES preprocessing script, for a simpler first pass (see plan's
    "Open risks" re: fine-tune quality tradeoff).

    huggingface/lerobot-gpu:latest already ships lerobot with pi0.5 support
    preinstalled (confirmed live: `import lerobot.policies.pi05` and
    PI05Policy both import with zero extra installs) in a uv-managed venv
    that has no `pip` binary at all -- a prior version of this script ran
    `pip install -q "lerobot[pi]"` here, which failed immediately with
    "pip: command not found" (exit 127) before training ever started. Do
    NOT re-add a pip/uv install line for this -- it's unnecessary.

    Confirmed live (full dry run, actual training steps executing on GPU)
    that three more fixes were needed beyond removing pip install:
    --dataset.root (without it, LeRobotDatasetMetadata ignores the mounted
    PVC entirely -- see dataset_mount_path's docstring -- and tries to
    re-download over the network, failing on the read-only mount);
    --policy.push_to_hub=false (cfg.validate() otherwise demands a
    --policy.repo_id to push the checkpoint to the Hub); and HF_TOKEN in the
    pod env (finetune_pipeline.py's submit_pipeline_run -- pi0.5's tokenizer
    processor loads config from PaliGemma's gated HF repo and 401s without it).

    STILL NEEDS VERIFICATION: whether lerobot-train handles DROID's
    camera/state layout correctly over a full 3000-step run (only the first
    ~10 steps were observed directly), and whether train_expert_only fits a
    single 48GB L40S for the full run (only ~25GB used in early steps).

    train_episodes excludes whatever split_episodes reserved for eval, via
    --dataset.episodes -- confirmed this flag's list-literal CLI syntax
    against LeRobot's own Makefile/CI examples (--dataset.episodes="[0]").
    Without this, the eval stage's "held-out" episodes were actually part of
    the training set the whole time (see split_episodes' docstring).

    chunk_size/empty_cameras are opt-in overrides for datasets that don't
    share DROID's fps or camera count -- confirmed real flags via
    `lerobot-train --policy.type=pi05 --help` on this same image, and a full
    (non-training) config-resolution dry run against a real --dataset.root
    confirmed they parse and resolve correctly together. A different fps
    changes the real-world time a fixed chunk_size covers; a dataset with
    fewer camera views than pi05_base's pretrained input_features needs
    padding via empty_cameras. Left unset (the default), the generated
    command is byte-identical to the pre-existing droid_100-only script,
    which needs neither.

    There used to be a rename_map flag here too, to remap a dataset's own
    camera key names to pi05_base's pretrained naming (e.g. 'world_camera'
    -> 'base_0_rgb'). Removed after confirming live it actively breaks
    training rather than helping: it renames the keys the DataLoader yields
    at batch time, but cfg.input_features (what PI05Policy._preprocess_images
    checks the batch against) gets resolved from the dataset's RAW,
    un-renamed meta/info.json names earlier in argument parsing -- the two
    sides then share zero key names, so every training step failed with
    "All image features are missing from the batch". Confirmed unnecessary
    besides: pretrained weight transfer from lerobot/pi05_base doesn't need
    matching camera key names at all ("Remapped 812 state dict keys / All
    keys loaded successfully" happened fine using a dataset's own raw
    camera names) -- that transfer is positional/structural, not
    name-matched. A dataset's own camera keys should just be left as-is.

    chunk_size and n_action_steps are related but not the same knob:
    chunk_size changes what the flow-matching loss actually supervises the
    model to predict (a training-time hyperparameter), while
    n_action_steps only controls how many of those predicted steps get
    executed before the policy replans against a fresh observation (a
    receding-horizon control choice pi05's own inference loop makes --
    confirmed live that n_action_steps=15 with chunk_size=50 parses and
    resolves fine, i.e. executing a short prefix of a longer prediction is
    a normal, valid combination, not a fallback). The one hard constraint
    (confirmed live via PI05Config.validate(), which pi05_base hits at its
    own default of 50/50): n_action_steps must not exceed chunk_size --
    "n_action_steps (50) cannot be greater than chunk_size (30)". So this
    only auto-caps n_action_steps down to chunk_size when the caller
    lowered chunk_size below 50 (pi05_base's confirmed pretrained default)
    without giving an explicit n_action_steps of their own -- an explicit
    n_action_steps always wins, letting a caller deliberately keep
    replanning more frequent than the prediction horizon.

    Returns (script, effective_n_action_steps) rather than just the script --
    get_recipe logs the latter into its MLflow params so an auto-capped run's
    provenance still records the value that actually got passed to
    lerobot-train, not just whatever the caller (or lack thereof) supplied.
