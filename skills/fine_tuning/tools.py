    """Start a fine-tuning run for a model against an already-staged dataset.

    This runs as a real KFP pipeline (train -> evaluate for pi05) against
    RHOAI's Data Science Pipelines, consuming real GPU-hours on the shared
    cluster for potentially hours. Only call this after you've discussed
    the recipe (which model, which dataset, roughly how long it'll take)
    with the user and they've explicitly said to proceed -- never call this
    speculatively. The pipeline advances through its own stages on its
    own (no manual "create the next stage" step needed); call
    get_finetune_run_status afterward to check progress.

    Resubmitting under an exp_name that already has a run is normally
    refused -- but if that prior run's state is FAILED (e.g. after fixing a
    dataset-format error with convert_dataset_to_v3), this proceeds and
    reuses the same checkpoint PVC, overwriting the failed attempt's output.

    Args:
        dataset_pvc_name: The PVC name of an already-pull_dataset-staged
            dataset (e.g. 'dataset-my-droid-set-pvc').
        exp_name: Short experiment name, lowercase alphanumeric and hyphens
            (used as the K8s resource name prefix and the pipeline run's name).
        model_name: Which fine-tuning recipe to use. Only 'pi05' exists so far.
        dataset_subset: For a PVC pulled from a repo that bundles several
            independent LeRobot datasets as subfolders rather than one
            dataset per repo (e.g. nvidia's
            PhysicalAI-Robotics-Manipulation-SingleArm), which subfolder to
            fine-tune on this run (e.g. 'panda-stack-platforms'). One
            pull_dataset call stages the whole repo; different runs can
            each pick a different dataset_subset from that same PVC without
            re-downloading anything. Leave unset for an ordinary
            one-dataset-per-repo PVC like droid_100.
        chunk_size: Overrides pi05_base's default action-chunk length (in
            dataset frames) -- a training-time choice, it changes what the
            model is actually supervised to predict. Only relevant for
            datasets whose fps differs from droid_100's 15fps: a fixed
            chunk_size covers a different real-world time horizon at a
            different fps, and should also stay well under the dataset's
            own typical episode length. Leave unset for droid_100.
        n_action_steps: How many of each predicted chunk's steps actually
            get executed before the policy replans against a fresh
            observation -- an inference-time choice, independent of
            chunk_size (confirmed live: n_action_steps=15 with
            chunk_size=50 is a valid combination, not just chunk_size's
            equal). Must not exceed chunk_size; if chunk_size is lowered
            and this is left unset, it's auto-capped to the new chunk_size
            so config resolution doesn't fail outright. Leave unset for
            droid_100.
        empty_cameras: Pads N empty/masked camera slots when a dataset has
            fewer camera views than pi05_base's pretrained checkpoint
            expects. Confirmed real flag via `lerobot-train --help` on this
            platform's own lerobot-gpu image. A dataset's own camera keys
            (e.g. 'world_camera', 'hand_camera') should otherwise be left
            as-is -- there used to be a rename_map param here to remap them
            to pi05_base's own naming (e.g. 'base_0_rgb'), removed after
            confirming live it actively breaks training: it renames the
            keys the DataLoader yields at batch time, but cfg.input_features
            (what PI05Policy._preprocess_images checks the batch against)
            gets resolved from the dataset's RAW, un-renamed meta/info.json
            names earlier in argument parsing, so the two sides end up
            sharing zero key names -- "All image features are missing from
            the batch" on the very first training step, 100% of the time.
            Turned out unnecessary anyway: pretrained weight transfer from
            lerobot/pi05_base doesn't need matching camera key names at all
            ("Remapped 812 state dict keys / All keys loaded successfully"
            happened fine using a dataset's own raw camera names) -- that
            transfer is positional/structural, not name-matched.
