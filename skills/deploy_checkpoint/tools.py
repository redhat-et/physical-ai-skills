"""Deploys a finished fine-tuning checkpoint as a live, scale-to-zero
InferenceService for side-by-side comparison against the base model -- e.g.
in the robotics playground (registering it there is a manual follow-up, not
done by these tools).

submit_finetune_run's checkpoint PVC lives in settings.datasets_namespace
(where the KFP/DSPA pipeline that produced it actually runs -- see
finetune_pipeline.py's DSPA_NAMESPACE), but serving happens in
settings.models_namespace (see platform/base/models/pi05/inferenceservice.yaml).
A Pod can never mount a PVC from a different namespace, so the checkpoint has
to be copied into a new PVC that actually lives in the models namespace
before anything can serve it. That copy is a small export/import Job pair
(mirroring datasets.py's pull_dataset/get_dataset_job_status Job-then-poll
idiom) rather than a blocking operation inside one tool call, since a full
checkpoint copy can take a couple of minutes: an export Job in the datasets
namespace mounts the checkpoint PVC read-only and serves it via
`python -m http.server`; an import Job in the models namespace mounts the new
destination PVC and crawls that HTTP listing with stdlib urllib (no wget --
python:3.11-slim doesn't ship it, and installing it via apt adds an
unnecessary external dependency).

Once the checkpoint's own PVC is populated, the InferenceService reuses the
existing openpi-runtime ServingRuntime as-is (platform/base/models/pi05/
servingruntime.yaml) -- it already just loads whatever's mounted at
/mnt/models, so no new runtime is needed, only a new storageUri.

Confirmed live against a real fine-tuned checkpoint: a lerobot-train
checkpoint's model.safetensors is NOT directly loadable by openpi-runtime's
native server as-is, despite finetune_recipes.py's docstring claiming zero
conversion is needed -- that claim holds for file *layout* (config.json +
model.safetensors + processor jsons) but not for the state-dict *key names*
inside model.safetensors. lerobot-train's PreTrainedPolicy.save_pretrained()
serializes the whole PI05Policy wrapper object (self.model = PI05Pytorch(...)
internally), so every key comes out prefixed "model." -- fine for LeRobot's
own symmetric from_pretrained() round-trip (which is what finetune_recipes.py's
own eval stage uses), but openpi-runtime's native loader
(train_config.model.load_pytorch -> safetensors.torch.load_model) loads
directly into a bare, unwrapped PI0Pytorch instance and needs unprefixed keys,
matching how the original lerobot/pi05_base HF checkpoint happens to be
exported. There's no lerobot-train flag to skip this -- the wrapper-object
serialization is inherent to how PreTrainedPolicy.save_pretrained() works for
every LeRobot policy type. _rewrite_checkpoint_keys below fixes this in the
import Job, entirely downstream of the fine-tuning pipeline: strips the
"model." prefix from every key, and drops the one tied embedding weight
(paligemma's language_model.embed_tokens.weight, tied to its output
embedding) that has no corresponding parameter in the bare PI0Pytorch module
and shows up as an extra "unexpected key" otherwise -- both confirmed via the
actual missing/unexpected key diff safetensors.torch.load_model raised
against a real checkpoint. Done via stdlib struct+json only (no safetensors/
torch dependency needed in the python:3.11-slim import container): rebuilds
the whole file with a freshly-sized compact header and the data section
rewritten by streaming only the kept tensors' byte ranges across in order,
skipping the dropped one. An in-place header-only patch (padding the
rewritten header to the original's exact byte length, leaving the data
section untouched) was the first approach tried, but safetensors' own
deserializer validates that data_offsets tile the data section contiguously
with no gaps -- confirmed live that leaving a dropped tensor's bytes in
place raises SafetensorError: InvalidOffset, so the data section has to be
recompacted too, not just the header.

The embed_tokens.weight drop is confirmed correct, not just an empirical
guess: LeRobot's own PI05Policy._fix_pytorch_state_dict_keys (which converts
the OPPOSITE direction, openpi -> lerobot) reveals why -- PaliGemma ties its
input embedding and output head to one parameter, so openpi's checkpoint
only ever stores lm_head.weight. LeRobot's module structure doesn't
implement that tying in code, so LeRobot's own loader clones lm_head.weight's
value into an extra embed_tokens.weight key to satisfy its own strict
loading. Going the reverse direction, dropping that same redundant key
(rather than the tied lm_head.weight itself) is the correct inverse of that
same operation. Confirmed independently: several open LeRobot GitHub issues
(#2208, #2307, #2119) report this exact key as a known, unresolved gap in
LeRobot's own remapper -- a real upstream incompatibility, not something
specific to this platform.

Also confirmed live: openpi-runtime's server separately needs
assets/<asset_id>/norm_stats.json (normalization stats), which lerobot-train
checkpoints don't produce at all -- LeRobot stores its own fitted normalizer
differently, inside policy_preprocessor_step_3_normalizer_processor.safetensors.
Rather than reverse-engineering that into openpi's norm_stats.json schema,
this reuses the base pi05_droid checkpoint's own norm_stats.json (same GCS
URL platform/base/models/pi05/model-download-job.yaml already fetches for
the base model) -- confirmed this is openpi's own documented, intended
mechanism for exactly this case (AssetsConfig's assets_dir/asset_id fields
are explicitly meant to "load assets from a different checkpoint or
centralized location" when fine-tuning on the same base robot/dataset
family), not an approximation. This fine-tuning run's own TrainConfig
(logged at serve time) confirms its asset_id is 'droid', same as the base
model's.

Only 'pi05' is supported, same restriction as finetune_recipes.get_recipe --
this only makes sense once a second fine-tuning recipe exists.
